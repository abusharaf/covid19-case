## Introduction
#### The problem first
This idea came to our mind when we tried to find an API ready-made system that can provide us with a geo-decoder service for human-readable addresses, but all of them were based on paid subscription (could cost a lot of money for highly used applications), therefore we've started to look for a geographical map provider service/application that can provide this information for us as an open-source project in order to build up the API layer as a service wrapper accordingly.

#### Solution
 **Pelias** was found as an open-source project for map and geocoder provider.

#### Goal => Motivation
What does this project do?
